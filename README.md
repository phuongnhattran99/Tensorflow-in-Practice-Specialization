# Tensorflow-in-Practice-Specialization
1) Best practices for TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework to train a neural network for a computer vision applications.  
2) Handle real-world image data and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropout.  
3) Build natural language processing systems using TensorFlow.  
4) Apply RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs as you train them using text repositories.
